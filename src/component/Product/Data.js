      "description": "Ferro Vanadium (FeV) is an alloy formed by combining iron and vanadium with a vanadium content range of 35%–85%. The production of this alloy results in a grayish silver crystalline solid. Ferro Vanadium is a universal hardener, strengthener and anti-corrosive additive for steels and other ferrous based products. Ferrovanadium is also used as an additive to improve the qualities of ferrous alloys.",

      "description": "Vanadium Pentoxide is an inorganic compound with the formula V2O5, commonly known as vanadium pentoxide, it is a brown/yellow solid, although when freshly precipitated from aqueous solution, its colour is deep orange. From the industrial perspective, it is the most important compound of vanadium, being the principal precursor to alloys of vanadium like Ferro Vanadium.",

      "description": "Ammonium Metavanadium is a white or slightly yellow coloured solid used in the purification of vanadium. Ammonium Metavanadium is used as a dryer for paints, in the dyeing and printing of textiles and is also widely used in photography. It is also used as a catalyst for organic synthesis, as the thermal decomposition of this substance gives Vanadium pentoxide, which is widely used as a catalyst for other vanadium compounds. Our proposed production capacity is 100 metric tons.",

      "btnName": "Ferro Molybdenum",
      "description": "Ferro Molybdenum is an alloy formed by combining iron and Molybdenum. It is an extremely versatile alloy used primarily in high-strength low alloys and stainless steels. It has numerous beneficial properties and can be used even in cast irons, some high-speed tool steels, and super-alloys applications. Adding Ferro Molybdenum to a material helps to improve weldability, corrosion and wear resistance as well to increase ferrite strength. For alloying with steel the ferromolybdenum is added to molten steel before casting.",
